# 🧠 C Programming Practice / Knowledge-Based Questions

### 1. Convert Centimetres to Inches
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a length in centimetres.  
If the user enters a negative length, the program should print that the entry is invalid.  
Otherwise, convert the length to inches and print the result.  
> (Note: 1 inch = 2.54 cm)

### 2. Item Price Calculator
A store charges ₹120 per item if you buy fewer than 10 items.  
If you buy between 10 and 99 items, the cost is ₹100 per item.  
If you buy 100 or more items, the cost is ₹70 per item.  
Write a program that asks the user how many items they are buying and prints the total cost.

### 3. Time After Given Hours
Write a program that reads from the user:  
- an hour between 1 to 12  
- a number of hours ahead  

Then print the time after that many hours.  
Example:  
```
Enter hour between 1-12: 9
How many hours ahead: 4
Time at that time would be 1 o'clock.
```

### 4. Check Closeness of Numbers
Ask the user for two numbers. Print `Close` if the numbers are within 0.001 of each other, and `Not close` otherwise.

---

### 5. Leap Year Checker
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except that years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400.  
Write a program that asks the user for a year and prints whether it is a leap year or not.

---

### 6. Triangle Validity Checker
Write a program to input the lengths of three sides of a triangle.  
Check if these sides will form a triangle or not.  
> (Rule: a + b > c, b + c > a, and c + a > b)

### 7. Digit to Word
Write a short program to input a single digit and print it in words.  
Example: Input: 4 → Output: Four

---

### 8. Prime Square Root Checker
Write a program to check whether the square root of a given number is prime or not.

---

### 9. Odd Numbers in Descending Order
Write a short program to print the first N odd numbers in descending order.

---

### 10. Print the Series
Write a short program to print the following series:  
```
0 1 4 7 10 40
0 1 -4 7 -10
```

---

### 11. Average Calculator
Write a program to find the average of a list of numbers entered through the keyboard.

---

### 12. Triangle Type Checker
Write a program to input three sides of a triangle and print whether it is an equilateral, scalene, or isosceles triangle.

---

### 13. Ends With 4 or 8
Write a program to take an integer `a` as input and check whether it ends with 4 or 8.  
If it ends with 4, print “Ends with 4”.  
If it ends with 8, print “Ends with 8”.  
Otherwise, print “Ends with neither”.

---

### 14. Tipsy-Topsy
Write a program to take N (N ≥ 20) as input from the user.  
Print numbers from 1 to N.  
- When the number is a multiple of 3, print `Tipsy`.  
- When it is a multiple of 7, print `Topsy`.  
- When it is a multiple of both, print `Tipsy Topsy`.

### 15. Largest Number
Write a short program to find the largest number from a list of numbers entered through the keyboard.

---

### 16. Second Largest Number
Write a program to input N numbers and then print the second largest number.

---

### 17. Palindrome Numbers
Given a list of integers, write a program to find those which are palindromes.  
Example: 4321234 is a palindrome as it reads the same from left to right and right to left.

---

### 18. Digit Analysis
Write a complete Python program to do the following:
1. Read an integer `X`  
2. Determine the number of digits in `X`  
3. Form an integer `Y` that has the number of digits in `X` as the tens place and the most significant digit of `X` as the ones place  
4. Output `Y`  

Example:  
If `X = 2134`, then `Y = 42` because there are 4 digits and the most significant digit is 2.

---

### 19. Divisibility Checker
Write a Python program to print every integer between 1 and `n` divisible by `m`.  
Also report whether the number that is divisible by `m` is even or odd.
